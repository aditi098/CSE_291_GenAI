A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear.

He was unable tomove and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst.

A Sheep passedby near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him.

"Please fetch me a drink of water," he begged, "that might giveme strength enough so I can get me some solid food.

" "Solid food!" said the Sheep.

"That means me, I suppose.

If Ishould bring you a drink, it would only serve to wash me downyour throat.

Don't talk to me about a drink!" A knave's hypocrisy is easily seen through.
