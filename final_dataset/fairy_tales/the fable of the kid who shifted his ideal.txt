Kid carrying a Death Message marked "Rush" stopped in front of a Show Window containing a Picture of James J.

Jeffries and began to weep bitterly.

A kind-hearted Suburbanite happened to be passing along on his Way to the 5:42 Train.

He was carrying a Dog Collar, a Sickle, a Basket of Egg Plums and a Bicycle Tire.

The Suburbanite saw the A.

Kid in Tears and it struck him that here was a Bully Chance to act out the Kind-Hearted Pedestrian who is always played up strong in the Sunday School Stories about Ralph and Edgar.

"Why do you weep?" he asked, peering at the Boy through his concavo-convex Nose Glasses.

"Oh, gee! I was just Thinking," replied the Urchin, brokenly.

"I was just Thinking what chance have I got to grow up and be the Main Stem, like Mr.

Jeffries.

" "What a perverted Ambition!" exclaimed the Suburbanite.

"Why do you set up Mr.

Jeffries as an Ideal? Why do you not strive to be like Me? Is it not worth a Life of Endeavor to command the Love and Respect of a Moral Settlement on the Outskirts? All the Conductors on our Division speak pleasantly to Me, and the Gateman has come to know my Name.

Last year I had my Half-Tone in the Village Weekly for the mere Cost of the Engraving.

When we opened Locust avenue from the Cemetery west to Alexander's Dairy, was I not a Member of the Committee appointed to present the Petition to the Councilmen? That's what I was! For Six Years I have been a Member of the League of American Wheelmen and now I am a Candidate for Director of our new four-hole Golf Club.

Also I play Whist on the Train with a Man who once lived in the same House with T.

DeWitt Talmage.

" Hearing these words the A.

Kid ceased weeping and cheerfully proceeded up an Alley, where he played "Wood Tag.

" Moral: As the Twig is Bent the Tree is Inclined.
