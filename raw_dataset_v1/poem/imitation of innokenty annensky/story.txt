And to you, my first vagary,Isaid goodbye. The east was turning blue,Though I didn't know what you meant,You said, simply: 'I'll not forget.'Other faces appear and vanish,Dear today, and tomorrow, done.Why is at this page alone,The corner is turned down?Forever the book opensTo the very same place, strange:It's as if the years have not passed,From the moment of farewell.Oh, who said that the heart is stone?I know: it is made of fire…I'll never understand: were you closeTo me, or simply loved me? 5 Add  Imitation of Innokenty Annensky to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
