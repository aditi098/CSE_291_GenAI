It's endless – the heavy, amber day!Impossible grief, pointless waiting!And the silver-voiced deer, again,Under the Northern Lights, belling.And I think there's cold snowA blue font for the poor and ill,And a little sledge's headlong flow,To the ancient chime of far-off bells. 7 Add  For Mikhail Lozinsky to your library.Return to the Anna Akhmatova library, or . . .
