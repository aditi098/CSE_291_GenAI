Once upon a time a waggoner's cart which was heavily laden with wine
had stuck so fast that in spite of all that he could do, he could not
get it to move again. Then it chanced that Our Lady just happened to
come by that way, and when she perceived the poor man's distress, she
said to him, "I am tired and thirsty, give me a glass of wine, and I
will set thy cart free for thee." "Willingly," answered the waggoner,
"but I have no glass in which I can give thee the wine." Then Our Lady
plucked a little white flower with red stripes, called field bindweed,
which looks very like a glass, and gave it to the waggoner. He filled
it with wine, and then Our Lady drank it, and in the self-same instant
the cart was set free, and the waggoner could drive onwards. The little
flower is still always called Our Lady's Little Glass.\n\n\t8.8
