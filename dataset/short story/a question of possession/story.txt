Along in the 80's there occurred a question of possession in regard
to a brand of horses, numbering nearly two hundred head. Courts had
figured in former matters, but at this time they were not appealed to,
owing to the circumstances. This incident occurred on leased
Indian lands unprovided with civil courts,--in a judicial sense,
"No-Man's-Land." At this time it seemed that might graced the
woolsack, while on one side Judge Colt cited his authority, only to be
reversed by Judge Parker, breech-loader, short-barreled, a full-choke
ten bore. The clash of opinions between these two eminent western
authorities was short, determined, and to the point.
A man named Gray had settled in one of the northwest counties in Texas
while it was yet the frontier, and by industry and economy of himself
and family had established a comfortable home. As a ranchman he had
raised the brand of horses in question. The history of this man is
somewhat obscured before his coming to Texas. But it was known and
admitted that he was a bankrupt, on account of surety debts which he
was compelled to pay for friends in his former home in Kentucky. Many
a good man had made similar mistakes before him. His neighbors spoke
well of him in Texas, and he was looked upon as a good citizen in
general.
Ten years of privation and hardship, in their new home, had been met
and overcome, and now he could see a ray of hope for the better. The
little prosperity which was beginning to dawn upon himself and family
met with a sudden shock, in the form of an old judgment, which he
always contended his attorneys had paid. In some manner this judgment
was revived, transferred to the jurisdiction of his district, and an
execution issued against his property. Sheriff Ninde of this county
was not as wise as he should have been. When the execution was placed
in his hands, he began to look about for property to satisfy the
judgment. The exemption laws allowed only a certain number of gentle
horses, and as any class of range horses had a cash value then, this
brand of horses was levied on to satisfy the judgment.
The range on which these horses were running was at this time an open
one, and the sheriff either relied on his reputation as a bad man, or
probably did not know any better. The question of possession did not
bother him. Still this stock was as liable to range in one county as
another. There is one thing quite evident: the sheriff had overlooked
the nature of this man Gray, for he was no weakling, inclined to sit
down and cry. It was thought that legal advice caused him to take the
step he did, and it may be admitted, with no degree of shame, that
advice was often given on lines of justice if not of law, in the Lone
Star State. There was a time when the decisions of Judge Lynch in that
State had the hearty approval of good men. Anyhow, Gray got a few
of his friends together, gathered his horses without attracting
attention, and within a day's drive crossed into the Indian Territory,
where he could defy all the sheriffs in Texas.
When this cold fact first dawned on Sheriff Ninde, he could hardly
control himself. With this brand of horses five or six days ahead
of him he became worried. The effrontery of any man to deny his
authority--the authority of a duly elected sheriff--was a reflection
on his record. His bondsmen began to inquire into the situation;
in case the property could not be recovered, were they liable as
bondsmen? Things looked bad for the sheriff.
The local papers in supporting his candidacy for this office had often
spoken of him and his chief deputy as human bloodhounds,--a terror
to evil doers. Their election, they maintained, meant a strict
enforcement of the laws, and assured the community that a better era
would dawn in favor of peace and security of life and property. Ninde
was resourceful if anything. He would overtake those horses, overpower
the men if necessary, and bring back to his own bailiwick that brand
of horse-stock. At least, that was his plan. Of course Gray might
object, but that would be a secondary matter. Sheriff Ninde would take
time to do this. Having made one mistake, he would make another to
right it.
Gray had a brother living in one of the border towns of Kansas, and
it was thought he would head for this place. Should he take the horses
into the State, all the better, as they could invoke the courts of
another State and get other sheriffs to help.
Sixty years of experience with an uncharitable world had made Gray
distrustful of his fellow man, though he did not wish to be so.
So when he reached his brother in Kansas without molestation, he
exercised caution enough to leave the herd of horses in the territory.
The courts of this neutral strip were Federal, and located at points
in adjoining States, but there was no appeal to them in civil cases.
United States marshals looked after the violators of law against the
government.
Sheriff Ninde sent his deputy to do the Sherlock act for him as soon
as the horses were located. This the deputy had no trouble in doing,
as this sized bunch of horses could not well be hidden, nor was there
any desire on the part of Gray to conceal them.
The horses were kept under herd day and night in a near-by pasture.
Gray usually herded by day, and two young men, one his son, herded
by night. Things went on this way for a month. In the mean time
the deputy had reported to the sheriff, who came on to personally
supervise the undertaking. Gray was on the lookout, and was aware of
the deputy's presence. All he could do was to put an extra man on herd
at night, arm his men well, and await results.
The deputy secretly engaged seven or eight bad men of the long-haired
variety, such as in the early days usually graced the frontier
towns with their presence. This brand of human cattle were not the
disturbing element on the border line of civilization that writers
of that period depicted, nor the authors of the bloodcurdling drama
portrayed. The average busy citizen paid little attention to them,
considering them more ornamental than useful. But this was about the
stripe that was wanted and could be secured for the work in hand. A
good big bluff was considered sufficient for the end in view. This
crowd was mounted, armed to the teeth, and all was ready. Secrecy was
enjoined on every one. Led by the sheriff and his deputy, they rode
out about midnight to the pasture and found the herd and herders.
"What do you fellows want here?" demanded young Gray, as Ninde and his
posse rode up.
"We want these horses," answered the sheriff.
"On what authority?" demanded Gray.
"This is sufficient authority for you," said the sheriff, flashing
a six-shooter in young Gray's face. All the heelers to the play now
jumped their horses forward, holding their six-shooters over their
heads, ratcheting the cylinders of their revolvers by cocking and
lowering the hammers, as if nothing but a fight would satisfy their
demand for gore.
"If you want these horses that bad," said young Gray, "I reckon you
can get them for the present. But I want to tell you one thing--there
are sixty head of horses here under herd with ours, outside the
'96' brand. They belong to men in town. If you take them out of this
pasture to-night, they might consider you a horse-thief and deal with
you accordingly. You know you are doing this by force of arms. You
have no more authority here than any other man, except what men and
guns give you. Good-night, sir, I may see you by daylight."
Calling off his men, they let little grass grow under their feet as
they rode to town. The young man roused his father and uncle, who in
turn went out and asked their friends to come to their assistance.
Together with the owners of the sixty head, by daybreak they had
eighteen mounted and armed men.
The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when
day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted, as there was
a brand or two there he had no claim on, just or unjust, and they must
be cut out or trouble would follow. One of the men with Ninde knew of
a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was
at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray
had departed at daybreak, they started. The pursuing posse soon took
the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they
headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard
ride to overtake them. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not
fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better
time than the herd could make under any circumstances.
After an hour's hard riding, it was evident, from the trail left, that
they were not far ahead. The fact that they were carrying off with
them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party
did not tend to fortify the sheriff in the good opinion of any of the
rescuers. It was now noticed that the herd had left the trail in the
direction of a place where there had formerly been a ranch house, the
corrals of which were in good repair, as they were frequently used for
branding purposes. On coming in sight of these corrals, Gray's
party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.
Gray said to his party, "Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open
the ball, if there is any." To the others of his party, it seemed that
the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined
features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though
some great object in life was about to be accomplished. Yet in that
determined look it was evident that he would rather be shot down like
a dog than yield to what he felt was tyranny and the denial of his
rights. When his party came within a quarter of a mile of the corrals,
it was noticed that Ninde and his deputies ceased their work, mounted
their horses, and rode out into the open, the sheriff in the lead, and
halted to await the meeting.
Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and
dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to
get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable
men. Every man in either party had his arms where they would be
instantly available should the occasion demand it. When Gray came
within easy hailing distance, his challenge was clear and audible to
every one. "What in hell are you doing with my horses?"
"I've got to have these horses, sir," answered Ninde.
"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
It was some moments before the party became communicative, as they
all had a respect for the old man's feelings. Ninde was on the uneasy
seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned
somewhat crestfallen. It may be added that the sheriff's bondsmen,
upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand
a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.
Gray said to his party, "Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open
the ball, if there is any." To the others of his party, it seemed that
the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined
features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though
some great object in life was about to be accomplished. Yet in that
determined look it was evident that he would rather be shot down like
a dog than yield to what he felt was tyranny and the denial of his
rights. When his party came within a quarter of a mile of the corrals,
it was noticed that Ninde and his deputies ceased their work, mounted
their horses, and rode out into the open, the sheriff in the lead, and
halted to await the meeting.
Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and
dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to
get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable
men. Every man in either party had his arms where they would be
instantly available should the occasion demand it. When Gray came
within easy hailing distance, his challenge was clear and audible to
every one. "What in hell are you doing with my horses?"
"I've got to have these horses, sir," answered Ninde.
"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
It was some moments before the party became communicative, as they
all had a respect for the old man's feelings. Ninde was on the uneasy
seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned
somewhat crestfallen. It may be added that the sheriff's bondsmen,
upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand
a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

Around the Spade Wagon\n\n\tThe range on which these horses were running was at this time an open
one, and the sheriff either relied on his reputation as a bad man, or
probably did not know any better. The question of possession did not
bother him. Still this stock was as liable to range in one county as
another. There is one thing quite evident: the sheriff had overlooked
the nature of this man Gray, for he was no weakling, inclined to sit
down and cry. It was thought that legal advice caused him to take the
step he did, and it may be admitted, with no degree of shame, that
advice was often given on lines of justice if not of law, in the Lone
Star State. There was a time when the decisions of Judge Lynch in that
State had the hearty approval of good men. Anyhow, Gray got a few
of his friends together, gathered his horses without attracting
attention, and within a day's drive crossed into the Indian Territory,
where he could defy all the sheriffs in Texas.
When this cold fact first dawned on Sheriff Ninde, he could hardly
control himself. With this brand of horses five or six days ahead
of him he became worried. The effrontery of any man to deny his
authority--the authority of a duly elected sheriff--was a reflection
on his record. His bondsmen began to inquire into the situation;
in case the property could not be recovered, were they liable as
bondsmen? Things looked bad for the sheriff.
The local papers in supporting his candidacy for this office had often
spoken of him and his chief deputy as human bloodhounds,--a terror
to evil doers. Their election, they maintained, meant a strict
enforcement of the laws, and assured the community that a better era
would dawn in favor of peace and security of life and property. Ninde
was resourceful if anything. He would overtake those horses, overpower
the men if necessary, and bring back to his own bailiwick that brand
of horse-stock. At least, that was his plan. Of course Gray might
object, but that would be a secondary matter. Sheriff Ninde would take
time to do this. Having made one mistake, he would make another to
right it.
Gray had a brother living in one of the border towns of Kansas, and
it was thought he would head for this place. Should he take the horses
into the State, all the better, as they could invoke the courts of
another State and get other sheriffs to help.
Sixty years of experience with an uncharitable world had made Gray
distrustful of his fellow man, though he did not wish to be so.
So when he reached his brother in Kansas without molestation, he
exercised caution enough to leave the herd of horses in the territory.
The courts of this neutral strip were Federal, and located at points
in adjoining States, but there was no appeal to them in civil cases.
United States marshals looked after the violators of law against the
government.
Sheriff Ninde sent his deputy to do the Sherlock act for him as soon
as the horses were located. This the deputy had no trouble in doing,
as this sized bunch of horses could not well be hidden, nor was there
any desire on the part of Gray to conceal them.
The horses were kept under herd day and night in a near-by pasture.
Gray usually herded by day, and two young men, one his son, herded
by night. Things went on this way for a month. In the mean time
the deputy had reported to the sheriff, who came on to personally
supervise the undertaking. Gray was on the lookout, and was aware of
the deputy's presence. All he could do was to put an extra man on herd
at night, arm his men well, and await results.
The deputy secretly engaged seven or eight bad men of the long-haired
variety, such as in the early days usually graced the frontier
towns with their presence. This brand of human cattle were not the
disturbing element on the border line of civilization that writers
of that period depicted, nor the authors of the bloodcurdling drama
portrayed. The average busy citizen paid little attention to them,
considering them more ornamental than useful. But this was about the
stripe that was wanted and could be secured for the work in hand. A
good big bluff was considered sufficient for the end in view. This
crowd was mounted, armed to the teeth, and all was ready. Secrecy was
enjoined on every one. Led by the sheriff and his deputy, they rode
out about midnight to the pasture and found the herd and herders.
"What do you fellows want here?" demanded young Gray, as Ninde and his
posse rode up.
"We want these horses," answered the sheriff.
"On what authority?" demanded Gray.
"This is sufficient authority for you," said the sheriff, flashing
a six-shooter in young Gray's face. All the heelers to the play now
jumped their horses forward, holding their six-shooters over their
heads, ratcheting the cylinders of their revolvers by cocking and
lowering the hammers, as if nothing but a fight would satisfy their
demand for gore.
"If you want these horses that bad," said young Gray, "I reckon you
can get them for the present. But I want to tell you one thing--there
are sixty head of horses here under herd with ours, outside the
'96' brand. They belong to men in town. If you take them out of this
pasture to-night, they might consider you a horse-thief and deal with
you accordingly. You know you are doing this by force of arms. You
have no more authority here than any other man, except what men and
guns give you. Good-night, sir, I may see you by daylight."
Calling off his men, they let little grass grow under their feet as
they rode to town. The young man roused his father and uncle, who in
turn went out and asked their friends to come to their assistance.
Together with the owners of the sixty head, by daybreak they had
eighteen mounted and armed men.
The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when
day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted, as there was
a brand or two there he had no claim on, just or unjust, and they must
be cut out or trouble would follow. One of the men with Ninde knew of
a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was
at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray
had departed at daybreak, they started. The pursuing posse soon took
the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they
headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard
ride to overtake them. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not
fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better
time than the herd could make under any circumstances.
After an hour's hard riding, it was evident, from the trail left, that
they were not far ahead. The fact that they were carrying off with
them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party
did not tend to fortify the sheriff in the good opinion of any of the
rescuers. It was now noticed that the herd had left the trail in the
direction of a place where there had formerly been a ranch house, the
corrals of which were in good repair, as they were frequently used for
branding purposes. On coming in sight of these corrals, Gray's
party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.

As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
It was some moments before the party became communicative, as they
all had a respect for the old man's feelings. Ninde was on the uneasy

uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Around the Spade Wagon\n\n\tGray had a brother living in one of the border towns of Kansas, and
it was thought he would head for this place. Should he take the horses
into the State, all the better, as they could invoke the courts of
another State and get other sheriffs to help.
Sixty years of experience with an uncharitable world had made Gray
distrustful of his fellow man, though he did not wish to be so.
So when he reached his brother in Kansas without molestation, he
exercised caution enough to leave the herd of horses in the territory.
The courts of this neutral strip were Federal, and located at points
in adjoining States, but there was no appeal to them in civil cases.
United States marshals looked after the violators of law against the
government.
Sheriff Ninde sent his deputy to do the Sherlock act for him as soon
as the horses were located. This the deputy had no trouble in doing,
as this sized bunch of horses could not well be hidden, nor was there
any desire on the part of Gray to conceal them.
The horses were kept under herd day and night in a near-by pasture.
Gray usually herded by day, and two young men, one his son, herded
by night. Things went on this way for a month. In the mean time
the deputy had reported to the sheriff, who came on to personally
supervise the undertaking. Gray was on the lookout, and was aware of
the deputy's presence. All he could do was to put an extra man on herd
at night, arm his men well, and await results.
The deputy secretly engaged seven or eight bad men of the long-haired
variety, such as in the early days usually graced the frontier
towns with their presence. This brand of human cattle were not the
disturbing element on the border line of civilization that writers
of that period depicted, nor the authors of the bloodcurdling drama
portrayed. The average busy citizen paid little attention to them,
considering them more ornamental than useful. But this was about the
stripe that was wanted and could be secured for the work in hand. A
good big bluff was considered sufficient for the end in view. This
crowd was mounted, armed to the teeth, and all was ready. Secrecy was
enjoined on every one. Led by the sheriff and his deputy, they rode
out about midnight to the pasture and found the herd and herders.
"What do you fellows want here?" demanded young Gray, as Ninde and his
posse rode up.
"We want these horses," answered the sheriff.
"On what authority?" demanded Gray.
"This is sufficient authority for you," said the sheriff, flashing
a six-shooter in young Gray's face. All the heelers to the play now
jumped their horses forward, holding their six-shooters over their
heads, ratcheting the cylinders of their revolvers by cocking and
lowering the hammers, as if nothing but a fight would satisfy their
demand for gore.
"If you want these horses that bad," said young Gray, "I reckon you
can get them for the present. But I want to tell you one thing--there
are sixty head of horses here under herd with ours, outside the
'96' brand. They belong to men in town. If you take them out of this
pasture to-night, they might consider you a horse-thief and deal with
you accordingly. You know you are doing this by force of arms. You
have no more authority here than any other man, except what men and
guns give you. Good-night, sir, I may see you by daylight."
Calling off his men, they let little grass grow under their feet as
they rode to town. The young man roused his father and uncle, who in
turn went out and asked their friends to come to their assistance.
Together with the owners of the sixty head, by daybreak they had
eighteen mounted and armed men.
The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when
day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted, as there was
a brand or two there he had no claim on, just or unjust, and they must
be cut out or trouble would follow. One of the men with Ninde knew of
a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was
at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray
had departed at daybreak, they started. The pursuing posse soon took
the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they
headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard
ride to overtake them. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not
fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better
time than the herd could make under any circumstances.
After an hour's hard riding, it was evident, from the trail left, that
they were not far ahead. The fact that they were carrying off with
them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party
did not tend to fortify the sheriff in the good opinion of any of the
rescuers. It was now noticed that the herd had left the trail in the
direction of a place where there had formerly been a ranch house, the
corrals of which were in good repair, as they were frequently used for
branding purposes. On coming in sight of these corrals, Gray's
party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.
Gray said to his party, "Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open
the ball, if there is any." To the others of his party, it seemed that
the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined
features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though
some great object in life was about to be accomplished. Yet in that
determined look it was evident that he would rather be shot down like
a dog than yield to what he felt was tyranny and the denial of his
rights. When his party came within a quarter of a mile of the corrals,
it was noticed that Ninde and his deputies ceased their work, mounted
their horses, and rode out into the open, the sheriff in the lead, and
halted to await the meeting.
Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and
dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to
get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable
men. Every man in either party had his arms where they would be
instantly available should the occasion demand it. When Gray came
within easy hailing distance, his challenge was clear and audible to
every one. "What in hell are you doing with my horses?"
"I've got to have these horses, sir," answered Ninde.
"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some

a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
It was some moments before the party became communicative, as they
all had a respect for the old man's feelings. Ninde was on the uneasy
seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned
somewhat crestfallen. It may be added that the sheriff's bondsmen,
upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand
a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

Around the Spade Wagon\n\n\tThe deputy secretly engaged seven or eight bad men of the long-haired
variety, such as in the early days usually graced the frontier
towns with their presence. This brand of human cattle were not the
disturbing element on the border line of civilization that writers
of that period depicted, nor the authors of the bloodcurdling drama
portrayed. The average busy citizen paid little attention to them,
considering them more ornamental than useful. But this was about the
stripe that was wanted and could be secured for the work in hand. A
good big bluff was considered sufficient for the end in view. This
crowd was mounted, armed to the teeth, and all was ready. Secrecy was
enjoined on every one. Led by the sheriff and his deputy, they rode
out about midnight to the pasture and found the herd and herders.
"What do you fellows want here?" demanded young Gray, as Ninde and his
posse rode up.
"We want these horses," answered the sheriff.
"On what authority?" demanded Gray.
"This is sufficient authority for you," said the sheriff, flashing
a six-shooter in young Gray's face. All the heelers to the play now
jumped their horses forward, holding their six-shooters over their
heads, ratcheting the cylinders of their revolvers by cocking and
lowering the hammers, as if nothing but a fight would satisfy their
demand for gore.
"If you want these horses that bad," said young Gray, "I reckon you
can get them for the present. But I want to tell you one thing--there
are sixty head of horses here under herd with ours, outside the
'96' brand. They belong to men in town. If you take them out of this
pasture to-night, they might consider you a horse-thief and deal with
you accordingly. You know you are doing this by force of arms. You
have no more authority here than any other man, except what men and
guns give you. Good-night, sir, I may see you by daylight."
Calling off his men, they let little grass grow under their feet as
they rode to town. The young man roused his father and uncle, who in
turn went out and asked their friends to come to their assistance.
Together with the owners of the sixty head, by daybreak they had
eighteen mounted and armed men.
The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when
day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted, as there was
a brand or two there he had no claim on, just or unjust, and they must
be cut out or trouble would follow. One of the men with Ninde knew of
a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was
at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray
had departed at daybreak, they started. The pursuing posse soon took
the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they
headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard
ride to overtake them. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not
fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better
time than the herd could make under any circumstances.
After an hour's hard riding, it was evident, from the trail left, that
they were not far ahead. The fact that they were carrying off with
them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party
did not tend to fortify the sheriff in the good opinion of any of the
rescuers. It was now noticed that the herd had left the trail in the
direction of a place where there had formerly been a ranch house, the
corrals of which were in good repair, as they were frequently used for
branding purposes. On coming in sight of these corrals, Gray's
party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.
Gray said to his party, "Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open
the ball, if there is any." To the others of his party, it seemed that
the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined
features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though
some great object in life was about to be accomplished. Yet in that
determined look it was evident that he would rather be shot down like
a dog than yield to what he felt was tyranny and the denial of his
rights. When his party came within a quarter of a mile of the corrals,
it was noticed that Ninde and his deputies ceased their work, mounted
their horses, and rode out into the open, the sheriff in the lead, and
halted to await the meeting.
Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and
dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to
get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable
men. Every man in either party had his arms where they would be
instantly available should the occasion demand it. When Gray came
within easy hailing distance, his challenge was clear and audible to
every one. "What in hell are you doing with my horses?"
"I've got to have these horses, sir," answered Ninde.
"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was

dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to
get action, or suffer a discount at the hands of heretofore peaceable
men. Every man in either party had his arms where they would be
instantly available should the occasion demand it. When Gray came
within easy hailing distance, his challenge was clear and audible to
every one. "What in hell are you doing with my horses?"
"I've got to have these horses, sir," answered Ninde.
"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
It was some moments before the party became communicative, as they
all had a respect for the old man's feelings. Ninde was on the uneasy
seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned
somewhat crestfallen. It may be added that the sheriff's bondsmen,
upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand
a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

Around the Spade Wagon\n\n\t"If you want these horses that bad," said young Gray, "I reckon you
can get them for the present. But I want to tell you one thing--there
are sixty head of horses here under herd with ours, outside the
'96' brand. They belong to men in town. If you take them out of this
pasture to-night, they might consider you a horse-thief and deal with
you accordingly. You know you are doing this by force of arms. You
have no more authority here than any other man, except what men and
guns give you. Good-night, sir, I may see you by daylight."
Calling off his men, they let little grass grow under their feet as
they rode to town. The young man roused his father and uncle, who in
turn went out and asked their friends to come to their assistance.
Together with the owners of the sixty head, by daybreak they had
eighteen mounted and armed men.
The sheriff paid no attention to the advice of young Gray, but when
day broke he saw that he had more horses than he wanted, as there was
a brand or two there he had no claim on, just or unjust, and they must
be cut out or trouble would follow. One of the men with Ninde knew of
a corral where this work could be done, and to this corral, which was
at least fifteen miles from the town where the rescue party of Gray
had departed at daybreak, they started. The pursuing posse soon took
the trail of the horses from where they left the pasture, and as they
headed back toward Texas, it was feared it might take a long, hard
ride to overtake them. The gait was now increased to the gallop, not
fast, probably covering ten miles an hour, which was considered better
time than the herd could make under any circumstances.
After an hour's hard riding, it was evident, from the trail left, that
they were not far ahead. The fact that they were carrying off with
them horses that were the private property of men in the rescue party
did not tend to fortify the sheriff in the good opinion of any of the
rescuers. It was now noticed that the herd had left the trail in the
direction of a place where there had formerly been a ranch house, the
corrals of which were in good repair, as they were frequently used for
branding purposes. On coming in sight of these corrals, Gray's
party noticed that some kind of work was being carried on, so they
approached it cautiously. The word came back that it was the horses.
Gray said to his party, "Keep a short distance behind me. I'll open
the ball, if there is any." To the others of his party, it seemed that
the supreme moment in the old man's life had come. Over his determined
features there spread a smile of the deepest satisfaction, as though
some great object in life was about to be accomplished. Yet in that
determined look it was evident that he would rather be shot down like
a dog than yield to what he felt was tyranny and the denial of his
rights. When his party came within a quarter of a mile of the corrals,
it was noticed that Ninde and his deputies ceased their work, mounted
their horses, and rode out into the open, the sheriff in the lead, and
halted to await the meeting.
Gray rode up to within a hundred feet of Ninde's posse, and
dismounting handed the reins of his bridle to his son. He advanced
with a steady, even stride, a double-barreled shotgun held as though
he expected to flush a partridge. At this critical juncture, his party
following him up, it seemed that reputations as bad men were due to

seat, for he would not return to the State, though his posse returned
somewhat crestfallen. It may be added that the sheriff's bondsmen,
upon an examination into the facts in the case, concluded to stand
a suit on the developments of some facts which their examination had
uncovered in the original proceedings, and the matter was dropped,
rather than fight it through in open court.

Around the Spade Wagon\n\n\t"Do you realize what it will take to get them?" asked Gray, as he
brought his gun, both barrels at full cock, to his shoulder. "Bat an
eye, or crook your little finger if you dare, and I'll send your soul
glimmering into eternity, if my own goes to hell for it." There was
something in the old man's voice that conveyed the impression that
these were not idle words. To heed them was the better way, if human
life had any value.
"Well, Mr. Gray," said the sheriff, "put down your gun and take your
horses. This has been a bad piece of business for us--take your horses
and go, sir. My bondsmen can pay that judgment, if they have to."
Gray's son rode around during the conversation, opened the gate, and
turned out the horses. One or two men helped him, and the herd was
soon on its way to the pasture.
As the men of his party turned to follow Gray, who had remounted, he
presented a pitiful sight. His still determined features, relaxed from
the high tension to which he had been nerved, were blanched to the
color of his hair and beard. It was like a drowning man--with the
strength of two--when rescued and brought safely to land, fainting
through sheer weakness. A reprieve from death itself or the blood of
his fellow man upon his hands had been met and passed. It was some
little time before he spoke, then he said: "I reckon it was best, the
way things turned out, for I would hate to kill any man, but I would
gladly die rather than suffer an injustice or quietly submit to what I
felt was a wrong against me."
