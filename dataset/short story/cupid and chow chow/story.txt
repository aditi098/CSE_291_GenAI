Ma began it by calling her rosy, dimpled, year-old baby Cupid, and
as he grew up the name became more and more appropriate, for
the pretty boy loved everyone, everyone loved him, and he made
those about him feel fond of one another, like a regular little god
of love. Especially beautiful and attractive did he look as he
pranced on the doorsteps one afternoon while waiting the arrival of
a little cousin. Our Cupid's costume was modernized out of regard
to the prejudices of society, and instead of wings, bandage, bow
and arrow, he was gorgeous to behold in small buckled shoes,
purple silk hose, black velvet knickerbockers, and jacket with a
lace collar, which, with his yellow hair cut straight across the
forehead, and falling in long, curling love-locks behind, made him
look like an old picture of a young cavalier.
It was impossible for the little sprig to help being a trifle vain
when everyone praised his comeliness, and every mirror showed
him a rosy face, with big blue eyes, smiling lips, white teeth, a
cunning nose, and a dimple in the chin, not to mention the golden
mane that hung about his neck.
Yes, Cupid was vain; and as he waited, he pranced, arranged the
dear buckled shoes in the first position, practised his best bow, felt
of his dimple, and smiled affably as he pictured to himself the
pleasure and surprise of the little cousin when he embraced her in
the ardent yet gentle way which made his greetings particularly
agreeable to those who liked such tender demonstrations.
Cupid had made up his mind to love Chow-chow very much, both
because she was his cousin, and because she must be interesting if
all papa's stories of her were true. Her very name was pleasing to
him, for it suggested Indian sweetmeats, though papa said it was
given to her because she was such a mixture of sweet and sour that
one never knew whether he would get his tongue bitten out by a
hot bit of ginger, or find a candied plum melting in his mouth
when he tried that little jar of Chow-chow.
"I know I shall like her, and of course she will like me lots 'cause
everybody does," thought Cupid, settling his love-locks and
surveying his purple legs like a contented young peacock.
Just then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tIt was impossible for the little sprig to help being a trifle vain
when everyone praised his comeliness, and every mirror showed
him a rosy face, with big blue eyes, smiling lips, white teeth, a
cunning nose, and a dimple in the chin, not to mention the golden
mane that hung about his neck.
Yes, Cupid was vain; and as he waited, he pranced, arranged the
dear buckled shoes in the first position, practised his best bow, felt
of his dimple, and smiled affably as he pictured to himself the
pleasure and surprise of the little cousin when he embraced her in
the ardent yet gentle way which made his greetings particularly
agreeable to those who liked such tender demonstrations.
Cupid had made up his mind to love Chow-chow very much, both
because she was his cousin, and because she must be interesting if
all papa's stories of her were true. Her very name was pleasing to
him, for it suggested Indian sweetmeats, though papa said it was
given to her because she was such a mixture of sweet and sour that
one never knew whether he would get his tongue bitten out by a
hot bit of ginger, or find a candied plum melting in his mouth
when he tried that little jar of Chow-chow.
"I know I shall like her, and of course she will like me lots 'cause
everybody does," thought Cupid, settling his love-locks and
surveying his purple legs like a contented young peacock.
Just then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tYes, Cupid was vain; and as he waited, he pranced, arranged the
dear buckled shoes in the first position, practised his best bow, felt
of his dimple, and smiled affably as he pictured to himself the
pleasure and surprise of the little cousin when he embraced her in
the ardent yet gentle way which made his greetings particularly
agreeable to those who liked such tender demonstrations.
Cupid had made up his mind to love Chow-chow very much, both
because she was his cousin, and because she must be interesting if
all papa's stories of her were true. Her very name was pleasing to
him, for it suggested Indian sweetmeats, though papa said it was
given to her because she was such a mixture of sweet and sour that
one never knew whether he would get his tongue bitten out by a
hot bit of ginger, or find a candied plum melting in his mouth
when he tried that little jar of Chow-chow.
"I know I shall like her, and of course she will like me lots 'cause
everybody does," thought Cupid, settling his love-locks and
surveying his purple legs like a contented young peacock.
Just then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tCupid had made up his mind to love Chow-chow very much, both
because she was his cousin, and because she must be interesting if
all papa's stories of her were true. Her very name was pleasing to
him, for it suggested Indian sweetmeats, though papa said it was
given to her because she was such a mixture of sweet and sour that
one never knew whether he would get his tongue bitten out by a
hot bit of ginger, or find a candied plum melting in his mouth
when he tried that little jar of Chow-chow.
"I know I shall like her, and of course she will like me lots 'cause
everybody does," thought Cupid, settling his love-locks and
surveying his purple legs like a contented young peacock.
Just then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I know I shall like her, and of course she will like me lots 'cause
everybody does," thought Cupid, settling his love-locks and
surveying his purple legs like a contented young peacock.
Just then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tJust then a carriage drove up the avenue, stopped at the foot of the
steps, and out skipped a tall, brown man, a small, pale lady, and a
child, who whisked away to the pond so rapidly that no one could
see what she was like. A great kissing and hand-shaking went on
between the papas and the mammas, and Cupid came in for a large
share, but did not enjoy it as much as usual, for the little girl had
fled and he must get at her. So the instant Aunt Susan let him go
he ran after the truant, quite panting with eagerness and all aglow
with amiable intentions, for he was a hospitable little soul, and he
loved to do the honors of his pleasant home like a gentleman.
A little figure, dressed in a brown linen frock, with dusty boots
below it, and above it a head of wild black hair, tied up with a
large scarlet bow, stood by the pond throwing atones at the swans,
who ruffled their feathers in stately anger at such treatment.
Suddenly a pair of velvet arms embraced her, and half turning she
looked up into a rosy, smiling face, with two red lips suggestively
puckered for a hearty kiss.
Chow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow's black eyes sparkled, and her little brown face
flushed red as her ribbon as she tried to push the boy away with a
shrill scream.
"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Don't be frightened. I'm Cupid. I must kiss you. I truly must. I
always do when people come, and I like you very much."
With this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tWith this soothing remark, the velvet arm pressed her firmly, and
the lips gave her several soft kisses, which owing to her struggles,
lit upon her nose, chin, top-knot, and ear; for, having begun, Cupid
did not know when to leave off.
But Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tBut Chow-chow's wrath was great, her vengeance swift, and
getting one hand free she flung the gravel it held full in the flushed
and smiling face of this bold boy who had dared kiss her without
leave. Poor Cupid fell back blinded and heartbroken at such a
return for his warm welcome, and while he stood trying to clear his
smarting eyes, a fierce little voice said close-by,-
"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Does it hurt?"
"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Oh! Dreadfully!"
"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I'm glad of it."
"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Then you don't love me?"
"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I hate you!"
"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I don't see why."
"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I don't like to be hugged and kissed. I don't let anybody but papa
and mamma do it, ever-so, now!"
"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"But I'm your cousin, and you must love me. Won't you please?"
besought Cupid, with one eye open and a great tear on his nose.
"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I'll see about it. I don't like crying boys," returned the
heard-hearted damsel.
"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Well, you made me; but I forgive you," and Cupid
magnanimously put out his hand for a friendly shake. But
Chow-chow was off like a startled deer, and vanished into the
house, singing at the top of her voice a nursery rhyme to this
effect,-
"And she bids you to come in,
With a dimple in her chin,
Billy boy, Billy boy"
When Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tWhen Cupid, with red eyes and a sad countenance, made his
appearance, he found Chow-chow on her father's knee eating cake,
while the elders talked. She had told the story, and now from the
safe stronghold of papa's arms condescended to smile upon the
conquered youth.
Cupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tCupid went to mamma, and in one long whisper told his woes;
then sat upon the cushion at her feet, and soon forgot them all in
the mingled joys of eating macaroons and giving Chow-chow
smile for smile across the hearth-rug.
"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I predict we shall be much amused and edified by the progress of
the friendship just begun," said Cupid's papa, a quiet man, who
loved children and observed them with affectionate interest.
"And I predict a hard time of it for your young man, if he attempts
to tame my strong-minded little woman here. Her mother's ideas
are peculiar, and she wants to bring Chow-chow up according to
the new lights, - with contempt for dress and all frivolous pursuits;
to make her hardy, independent, and quite above caring for such
trifles as love, domestic life, or the feminine accomplishments we
used to find so charming."
As Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tAs Chow-chow's papa spoke, he looked from the child in her ugly
gray frock, thick boots, and mop of hair tied up in a style neither
pretty nor becoming, to his wife in her plain dress with her knob of
hair, decided mouth, sarcastic nose, and restless eyes that seemed
always on the watch to find some new wrong and protest against it.
"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Now, George, how can you misrepresent my views and principles
so? But it's no use trying to convince or out-talk you. We never get
a chance, and our only hope is to bring up our girls so that they
may not be put down as we are," returned Mrs. Susan, with a
decided air.
"Show us how you are going to defend your sex and conquer ours,
Chow-chow; give us your views generally. Now, then, who is in
favor of the Elective Franchise?" said Uncle George, with a
twinkle of the eye.
Up went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tUp went Aunt Susan's hand, and to the great amusement of all up
went Chow-chow's also and, scrambling to her feet on papa's knee,
she burst into a harangue which convulsed her hearers, for in it the
child's voice made queer work with the long words, and the red
bow wagged belligerently as she laid down the law with energy,
and defined her views, closing with a stamp of her foot"'This is our
platform: Free speech, free love, free-soil, free every thing; anti
Woman's Puckerage for ever!"
Even Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tEven Aunt Susan had to laugh at that burst, for it was delivered
with such vigor that the speaker would have fallen on her nose if
she had not been sustained by a strong arm.
Cupid laughed because the rest did, and then turned his big eyes
full of wonder on his mother, asking what it all meant.
"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Only fun, my dear."
"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Now, Ellen, that's very wrong. Why don't you explain this great
subject to him, and prepare him to take a nobler part in the coming
struggle than those who have come before him have done?" said
Mrs. Susan, with a stern look at her husband, who was petting the
little daughter, who evidently loved him best.
"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I don't care to disturb his happy childhood with quarrels beyond
his comprehension. I shall teach him to be as good and just a man
as his father, and feel quite sure that no woman will suffer wrong
at his hands," returned Mrs. Ellen, smiling at Cupid's papa, who
nodded back as if they quite understood one another.
"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"We never did agree and we never shall so I will say no more; but
we shall see what a good effect my girl's strength of character will
have upon your boy, who has been petted and spoiled by too much
tenderness."
So Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tSo Aunt Susan settled the matter; and as the days went on, the
elder people fell into the way of observing how the little pair got
on together and were much amused by the vicissitudes of that
nursery romance.
In the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tIn the beginning Chow-chow rode over Cupid rough-shod quite
trampled upon him in fact; and he bore it, because he wanted her
to like him, and had been taught that the utmost courtesy was due a
guest. But when he got no reward for his long-suffering patience
he was sometimes tempted to rebel, and probably would have done
so if he had not had mamma to comfort and sustain him.
Chow-chow was very quick at spying out the weaknesses of her
friends and alarmingly frank in proclaiming her discoveries; so
poor Cupid's little faults were seen and proclaimed very soon and
life made a burden to him, until he found out the best way of
silencing his tormentor was by mending the faults.
"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"My papa says you are a dandy-prat, and you are," said
Chow-chow, one day when the desire to improve her race was very
strong upon her.
"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"What is a dandy prat?" asked Cupid, looking troubled at the new
accusation.
"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I asked him, and he said a vain fellow; and you are vain,-so now!"
"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Am I?" and Cupid stopped to think it over.
"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Yes; you're horrid vain of your hair, and your velvet clothes, and
the dimple in your chin. I know it 'cause you always look in the
glass when you're dressed up, and keep feeling of that ugly hole in
your chin, and I see you brush your hair ever so much." Poor Cupid
colored up with shame, and turned his back to the mirror, as the
sharp-tongued young monitor went on:- "My mamma said if you
were her boy she'd cut off your curls, put you in a plain suit, and
stick some court-plaster over that place till you forgot all about it."
Chow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow expected an explosion of grief or anger after that last
slap; but to her amazement the boy walked out of the room without
a word. Going up to his mother as she sat busy with a letter, he
asked in a very earnest voice,-
"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Mamma, am I vain?"
"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I'm afraid you are a little, my dear," answered mamma, deep in
her letter.
With a sad but resolute face, Cupid went back to Chow-chow,
bearing a pair of shears in one hand and a bit of court-plaster in the
other.
"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"You may cut my hair off, if you want to. I ain't going to be a
dandy-prat anymore," he said, offering the fatal shears with the
calmness of a hero.
Chow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow was much surprised, but charmed with the idea of
shearing this meek sheep, so she snipped and slashed until the
golden locks lay shining on the floor, and Cupid's head looked as if
rats had been gnawing on his hair.
"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Do you like me better now?" he asked, looking in her eyes as his
only mirror, and seeing there the most approving glance they had
ever vouchsafed him.
"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Yes, I do; girl-boys are hateful."
He might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tHe might have retorted, "So are boy-girls," but he was a
gentleman, so he only smiled and held up his chin for her to cover
the offending dimple, which she did with half a square of black
plaster.
"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I shall never wear my velvet clothes any more unless mamma
makes me, and I don't think she will when I tell her about it, 'cause
she likes to have me cure my faults," said Cupid when the sacrifice
was complete, and even stern Chow-chow was touched by the
sweetness with which he bore the rebuke, the courage with which
he began the atonement for his little folly. When he appeared at
dinner, great was the out-cry; and when the story was told, great
was the effect produced. Aunt Susan said with satisfaction,-
"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"You see what an excellent effect my girl's Spartan training has on
her, and how fine her influence is on your effeminate boy."
Uncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tUncle George laughed heartily, but whispered something to
Chow-chow that made her look ashamed and cast repentant
glances at her victim. Cupid's papa shook hands with the boy and
said, smiling, "I am rather proud of my 'dandy-prat,' after all."
But mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tBut mamma grieved for the lost glory of her little Absalom, and
found it hard to pardon naughty Chow-chow, until Cupid looked
up at her with a grave, clear look which even the big patch could
not spoil, and said manfully,-
"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"You know, I was vain, mamma, but I won't be any more, and
you'll be glad, because you love me better than my hair, don't
you?"
Then she hugged the cropped head close, and kissed the hidden
dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little
lad in the rough gray suit, as if his sacrifice had only made him
more beautiful in her eyes.
Chow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

dimple without a word of reproach; but she laid the yellow locks
away as if she did love them after all, and often followed the little

treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow was quite affable for some days after this prank, and
treated her slave with more gentleness, evidently feeling that,
though belonging to an inferior race, he deserved a trifle of regard
for his obedience to her teachings. But her love of power grew by
what it fed on and soon brought fresh woe to faithful Cupid, who
adored her, though she frowned upon his little passion and gave
him no hope.
"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"You are a 'fraid-cat," asserted her majesty, one afternoon as they
played in the stable, and Cupid declined to be kicked by the horse
Chow-chow was teasing.
"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"No, I ain't; but I don't like to be hurt, and it's wrong to fret
Charley, and I won't poke him with my hoe."
"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Well, it isn't wrong to turn this thing, but you don't dare to put
your finger on that wheel and let me pinch it a little bit," added
Chow-chow, pointing to some sort of hay-cutting machine that
stood nearby.
"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"What for?" asked Cupid, who did object to being hurt in any way.
"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"To show you ain't a 'fraid cat. I know you are. I'm not, see there,"
and Chow-chow gave her own finger a very gentle squeeze.
"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I can bear it harder than that," and devoted Cupid laid his plump
finger between two wheels, bent on proving his courage at all
costs.
Chow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow gave a brisk turn to the handle, slipped in doing so,
and brought the whole weight of the cruel cogs on the tender little
finger, crushing the top quite flat. Blood flowed, Chow-chow
stopped aghast; and Cupid, with one cry of pain, caught and
reversed the handle, drew out the poor finger, walked unsteadily in
to mamma, saying, with dizzy eyes and white lips, "She didn't
mean to do it," and then fainted quite away in a little heap at her
feet.
The doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe doctor came flying, shook his head over the wound, and drew
out a case of dreadful instruments that made even strong-minded
Aunt Susan turn away her head, and bound up the little hand that
might never be whole and strong again. Chow-chow stood by quite
white and still until it was all over and Cupid asleep in his mother
a arms; then she dived under the sofa and sobbed there, refusing to
be comforted until her father came home. What that misguided
man said to her no one ever knew, but when Cupid was propped up
on the couch at tea-time, Chow-chow begged piteously to be
allowed to feed him.
The be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"

exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in

The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe be wounded hero, with his arm in a sling, permitted her to
minister to him; and she did it so gently, so patiently, that her
father said low to Mrs. Ellen,-
"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her

Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.

"I am afraid I did."

setting up the fallen rostrum.

His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace

"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I have hopes of her yet, for all the woman is not taken out of her,
in spite of the new lights."
When they parted for the evening, Cupid, who had often sued for a
good-night kiss and sued in vain, was charmed to see the red
top-knot bending over him, and to hear Chow-chow whisper, with
a penitent kiss, "I truly didn't mean to, Coopy."
The well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,

So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb

"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed

proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and

But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe well arm held her fast as the martyr whispered back, "Just say
I ain't a 'fraid-cat, and I don't mind smashing my finger."
Chow-chow said it that night and thought it next day and for many
following days, for each morning, when the doctor came to dress
the "smashed" finger, she insisted on being by as a sort of penance.
She forced herself to watch the bright instruments without
shivering, she ran for warm water, she begged to spread the salve
on the bandage, to hold the smelling-bottle, and to pick all the lint
that was used.
And while she performed these small labors of love, she learned a
little lesson that did her more good than many of mamma's
lectures. For Cupid showed her the difference between the rash
daring that runs foolish risks, and the steady courage that bears
pain without complaint. Every day the same scene took place;
Chow-chow would watch for and announce the doctor; would
bustle out the salve-box, bandage, and basin, set the chair, and call
Cupid from his book with a new gentleness in her voice.
The boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.

Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in

So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe boy would answer at once, take his place, and submit the poor
swollen hand to the ten minutes torture of little probes and
scissors, caustic and bathing, without a word, a tear, or a sound of
suffering. He only turned his head away, grew white about the lips,
damp on the forehead, and when it was all over would lean against
his mother for a minute, faint and still. Then Chow-chow would
press her hands together with a sigh of mingled pity, admiration,
and remorse, and when the boy looked up to say stoutly, "It didn't
hurt very much," she would put his sling on for him, and run
before to settle the pillows, carry him the little glass of wine and
water he was to take, and hover round him until he was quite
himself again, when she would subside close by, and pick lint or
hem sails while he read aloud to her from one of his dear books.
"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.

damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"It is a good lesson in surgery and nursing for her. I intend to have
her study medicine if she shoes any fondness for it," said Aunt
Susan.
"It is a good lesson in true courage, and I am glad to have her learn
it early," added uncle George, who now called Cupid "trump"
instead of a "dandy-prat."
"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a

"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and

back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,

could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"It is a good lesson in loving and serving others for love's sake, as
all women must learn to do soon or late," said gentle Mrs. Ellen.
"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave

Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.

"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and

"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"It is teaching them both how to bear and forbear, to teach and
help, and comfort one another, and take the pains and pleasures of
life as they should do together," concluded Cupid's papa, watching
the little couple with the wise kind eyes that saw a pretty story in
their daily lives.
Slowly the finger healed, and to every one's surprise was not much
disfigured which Cupid insisted was entirely owing to
Chow-chow's superior skill in spreading salve and picking lint.
Before this time, however, Chow-chow, touched by his brave
patience, his generous refusal to blame her for the mishap, and his
faithful affection, had in a tender moment confessed to her little
lover that she did "like him a great deal," and consented to go and
live in the old swan-house on the island in the pond as soon as he
was well enough.
But no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she

"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and

"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tBut no sooner had she enraptured him by these promises than she
dashed his joy by adding certain worldly conditions which she had
heard discussed by her mamma and her friends.
"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and

"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.

strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a

"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"But we can't be married until we have a lot of money. Nobody
does, and we must have ever so much to buy things with."
"Yes, but papa said he'd give us some little furniture to put in our
house, and mamma will let us have as much cake and milk-tea as
we want, and I shall be very fond of you, and what's the use of
money?" asked the enamoured Cupid, who believed in love in a
cottage, or swan-house rather.
"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.

"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how

would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.

"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to

reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I shan't marry a poor boy, so now!" was the mercenary
Chow-chow's decision.
"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and

Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her

Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in

return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach

Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Well, I'll see how much I've got; but I should think you would like
me just as well without," and Cupid went away to inspect his
property with as much anxiety as any man preparing for
matrimony.
But Cupid's finances were in a bad state, for he spent his
pocket-money as fast as he got it, and had lavished gifts upon his
sweetheart with princely prodigality. So he punched a hole in his
savings-bank and counted his small hoard, much afflicted to find it
only amounted to seventy-eight cents, and a button put in for fun.
Bent on winning his mistress no sacrifice seemed too great, so he
sold his livestock, consisting of one lame hen, a rabbit, and a
choice collection of caterpillars. But though he drove sharp
bargains, these sales only brought him in a dollar or two. Then he
went about among his friends, and begged and borrowed small
sums, telling no one his secret lest they should laugh at him, but
pleading for a temporary accommodation so earnestly and prettily
that no one could refuse.
When he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.

other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tWhen he had strained every nerve and tried every wile, he counted
up his gains and found that he had four dollars and a half. That
seemed a fortune to the innocent; and, getting it all in bright
pennies, he placed it in a new red purse, and with pardonable pride
laid his offering at Chow-chow's feet.
But alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tBut alas for love's labor lost! The cruel fair crushed all his hopes
by saying coldly,-
"That isn't half enough. We ought to have ten dollars, and I won't
like you until you get it."
"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.

and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"O Chow-chow! I tried so hard; do play it's enough," pleaded poor
Cupid.
"No, I shan't. I don't care much for the old swan-house now, and
you ain't half so pretty as you used to be."
"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at

"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if

would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to

Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so

"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and

after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented

damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,

arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"You made me cut my hair off, and now you don't love me 'cause
I'm ugly," cried the afflicted little swain, indignant at such
injustice.
But Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a

equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tBut Chow-chow was in a naughty mood, so she swung on the gate,
and would not relent in spite of prayers and blandishments.
"I'll get some more money somehow, if you will wait. Will you,
please?"
"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.

So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I'll see 'bout it."
And with that awful uncertainty weighing upon his soul, poor
Cupid went away to wrestle with circumstances. Feeling that
matters had now reached a serious point, he confided his anxieties
to mamma; and she, finding that it was impossible to laugh or
reason him out of his untimely passion, comforted him by
promising to buy at high prices all the nose-gays he could gather
out of his own little garden.
"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew

"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token

not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"But it will take a long time to make ten dollars that way. Don't
you think Chow-chow might come now, when it is all warm and
pleasant, and not stop until summer is gone, and no birds and
flowers and nice things to play with? It's so hard to wait," sighed
Cupid, holding his cropped head in his hands, and looking the
image of childish despair.
"So it is, and I think Chow-chow is a little goose not to go at once
and enjoy young love's dream without wasting precious time trying
to make money. Tell her papa said so, and he ought to know,"
added Uncle George, under his breath, for he had tried it, and
found that it did not work well.
Cupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in

said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tCupid did tell her, but little madam had got the whim into her
perverse head and the more she was urged to give in, the more
decided she grew. So Cupid accepted his fate like a man, and
delved away in his garden, watering his pinks, weeding his
mignonette, and begging his roses to bloom as fast and fair as they
could, so that he might be happy before the summer was gone.
Rather a pathetic little lover, mamma thought, as she watched him
tugging away with the lame hand, or saw him come beaming in
with his posies to receive the precious money that was to buy a
return for his loyal love.
Tender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tTender-hearted, Mrs. Ellen tried to soften Chow-chow and teach
her sundry feminine arts against the time she went to housekeeping
on the island, for Mrs. Susan was so busy hearing lectures, reading
reports, and attending to the education of other people's children
that her own ran wild. In her good moods, Chow-chow took kindly
to the new lessons, and began to hem a table-cloth for the domestic
board at which she was to preside; also swept and dusted now and
then, and once cooked a remarkable mess, which she called
"Coopy's favorite pudding," and intended to surprise him with it
soon after the wedding. But these virtuous efforts soon flagged, the
table-cloth was not finished, the duster was converted into a
fly-killer, and her dolls lay unheeded in corners after a few
attempts at dressing and nursing had ended in ennui.
How long matters would have gone on in this unsatisfactory way
no one knows; but a rainy day came, and the experiences it gave
the little pair brought things to a crisis.
The morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe morning was devoted to pasting pictures and playing horse all
over the house, with frequent pauses for refreshment and an
occasional squabble. After dinner, as the mammas sat sewing and
the papas talking or reading in one room, the children played in the
other, quite unconscious that they were affording both amusement
and instruction to their elders.
"Let's play house," suggested Cupid, who was of a domestic turn,
and thought a little rehearsal would not be amiss."Well, I will,"
consented Chow-chow, who was rather subdued by the violent
exercises of the morning.
So a palatial mansion was made of chairs, the dolls' furniture
arranged, the stores laid in, and housekeeping begun.
"Now, you must go off to your business while I tend to my work,"
said Chow-chow, after they had breakfasted off a seed-cake and
sugar and water tea in the bosom of their family.
Cupid obediently put on papa's hat, took a large book under his
arm, and went away to look at pictures behind curtains, while Mrs.
C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did

C bestirred herself at home in a most energetic manner, spanking
her nine dolls until their cries rent the air, rattling her dishes with
perilous activity, and going to market with the coal-hod for her
purchases.
Mr. Cupid returned to dinner rather early, and was scolded for so
doing, but pacified his spouse by praising her dessert,-a sandwich
of sliced apple, bread, and salt, which he ate like a martyr.
A ride on the rocking-horse with his entire family about him filled
the soul of Mr. Cupid with joy, though the trip was rendered a little
fatiguing by his having to dismount frequently to pick up the
various darlings as they fell out of his pockets or their mother's
arms as she sat behind him on a ______________.
"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Isn't this beautiful?" he asked, as they swung to and fro,-Mrs.
Cupid leaning her head on his shoulder, and dear little Claribel
Maud peeping out of his breast-pocket, while little Walter
Hornblower and Rosie Ruth, the twins, sat up between the horse's
ears, their china faces beaming in a way to fill a father's heart with
pride.
"It will be much nicer if the horse runs away and we all go smash.
I'll pull out his tail, then he'll rear, and we must tumble off,"
proposed the restless Mrs. C., whose dramatic soul delighted in
tragic adventures.
So the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.

up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tSo the little papa's happy moment was speedily banished as he
dutifully precipitated himself and blooming family upon the floor,
to be gathered up and doctored with chalk and ink, and plasters of
paper stuck all over their faces.
When this excitement subsided, it was evening, and Mrs. Cupid
bundled her children off to bed, saying,-
"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one

Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-

Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment

Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and

after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented

"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that

"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and

setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play

"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Now, you must go to your club, and I am going to my lecture."
"But I thought you'd sew now and let me read to you, and have our
little candles burn, and be all cosey, like papa and mamma,"
answered Cupid, who already felt the discomfort of a
strong-minded wife.
"My papa and mamma don't do so. He always goes to the club, and
smokes and reads papers and plays chess, and mamma goes to
Woman's Puckerage meetings,-so I must."
"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.

and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.





9.7














 Add  Cupid and Chow Chow to your library.




Return to the Louisa May Alcott library
, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Let me go, too; I never saw a Puckerage lecture, and I'd like to,"
said Cupid, who felt that a walk arm-in-arm with his idol would
make any sort of meeting endurable.
"No, you can't! Papa never goes; he says they are all gabble and
nonsense, and mamma says his club is all smoke and slang, and
the never go together."
Chow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget

"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.

"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a

would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one

Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice

"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tChow-chow locked the door, and the little pair went their separate
ways, while the older pair in the other room laughed at the joke,
yet felt that Cupid's plan was the best, and wondered how Ellen
and her husband managed to get on so well.
Chow-chow's lecture did not seem to be very interesting, for she
was soon at home again. But Mr. Cupid, after smoking a
lamp-lighter with his feet up, fell to reading a story that interested
him, and forgot to go home until he finished it. Then, to his great
surprise, he was told that it was morning, that he had been out all
night, and couldn't have any breakfast. This ruffled him, and he
told madam she was a bad wife, and he wouldn't love her if she did
not instantly give him his share of the little pie presented by cook,
as a bribe to keep them out of the kitchen.
Mrs. C. sternly refused, and locked up the pie, declaring that she
hated housekeeping and wouldn't live with him anymore, which
threat she made good by quitting the house, vowing not to speak to
him again that day, but to play alone, free and happy.
The deserted husband sat down among his infants with despair in
his soul, while the spirited wife, in an immense bonnet, pranced
about the room, waving the key of the pie-closet and rejoicing in
her freedom. Yes, it was truly pathetic to see poor Mr. Cupid's
efforts at housekeeping and baby-tending; for, feeling that they had
a double claim upon him now, he tried to do his duty by his
children. But he soon gave it up, piled them all into one bed, and
covered them with a black cloth, saying mournfully, "I'll play they
all died of mumps, then I can sell the house and go away. I can't
bear to stay here when she is gone."
The house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with

glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tThe house was sold, the dead infants buried under the sofa, and
then the forsaken man was a homeless wanderer. He tried in many
ways to amuse himself. He travelled to China on the tailless horse,
went to California in a balloon, and sailed around the world on a
raft made of two chairs and the hearth-brush. But these wanderings
always ended near the ruins of his home, and he always sat down
for a moment to watch the erratic movements of his wife.
That sprightly lady fared better than he, for her inventive fancy
kept her supplied with interesting plays, though a secret sense of
remorse for her naughtiness weighed upon her spirits at times. She
had a concert, and sang surprising medleys, with drum
accompaniments. She rode five horses in a circus, and jumped
over chairs and foot-stools in the most approved manner. She had
a fair, a fire, and a shipwreck; hunted lions, fished for crocodiles,
and played be a monkey in a style that would have charmed
Darwin.
But somehow none of these festive games had their usual relish.
There was no ardent admirer to applaud her music, no two-legged
horse to help her circus with wild prancings and life-like neighs,
no devoted friend and defender to save her from the perils of flood
and fire, no comrade to hunt with her, no fellow-monkey to skip
from perch to perch with social jabberings, as they cracked their
cocoa-nuts among imaginary palms. All was dull and tiresome.
A strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to

"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

, or . . . Read the next short story; 
Debby's Debut\n\n\tA strong sense of loneliness fell upon her, and for the first time she
appreciated her faithful little friend. Then the pie weighed upon
her conscience; there it was, wasting its sweetness in the closet,
and no one ate it. She had not the face to devour it alone; she could
not make up her mind to give it to Cupid; and after her fierce
renunciation of him, how could she ask him to forgive her?
Gradually her spirits declined, and about the time that the other
wanderer got back from his last trip she sat down to consider her
position.
Hearing no noise in the other room, Uncle George peeped in and
saw the divided pair stting in opposite corners, looking askance at
each other, evidently feeling that a wide gulf lay between them,
and longing to cross it, yet not quite knowing how. A solemn and
yet a comical sight, so Uncle George beckoned the others to come
and look.
"My boy will give in first. See how beseechingly he looks at the
little witch!" whispered Mrs. Ellen, laughing softly.
"No, he won't; she hurt his feelings very much by leaving him, and
he won't relent until she goes back; then he'll forgive and forget
like a man," said Cupid's papa.
"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite

on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I hope my girl will remain true to her principles," began Aunt
Susan.
"She'll be a miserable baby if she does," muttered Uncle George.
"I was going to say that, finding she has done wrong, I hope she
will have the courage to say so, hard as it is, and so expiate her
fault and try to do better," added Aunt Susan, fast and low, with a
soft look in her eyes, as she watched the little girl sitting alone,
while so much honest affection was waiting for her close by, if
pride would let her take it.
Somehow Uncle George's arm went round her waist when she said
that, and he gave a quick nod, as if something pleased him very
much.
"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-

ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Shall I speak, and help the dears bridge over their little trouble?"
asked Mrs. Ellen, pretending not to see the older children making
up their differences behind her.
"No; let them work it out for themselves. I'm curious to see how
they will manage," said papa, hoping that his boy's first little love
would prosper in spite of thorns among the roses.
So they waited, and presently the affair was settled in a way no one
expected. As if she could not bear the silence any longer,
Chow-chow suddenly bustled up, saying to herself,-
"I haven't played a lecture. I always like that, and here's a nice
place."
Pulling out the drawers of a secretary like steps, she slowly
mounted to the wide ledge atop, and began the droll preachment
her father had taught her in ridicule of mamma's hobby.
"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and

with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Do stop her, George; it's so absurd," whispered Mrs. Susan.
"Glad you think so, my dear," laughed Uncle George.
"There is some sense in it, and I have no doubt the real and true
will come to pass when we women learn how far to go, and how to
fit ourselves for the new duties by doing the old ones well," said
Mrs. Ellen, who found good in all things, and kept herself so
womanly sweet and strong that no one could deny her any right she
chose to claim.
"She is like so many of those who mount your hobby, Susan, and
ride away into confusions of all sorts, leaving empty homes behind
them. The happy, womanly women will have the most influence
after all, and do the most to help the bitter, sour, discontented
ones. They need help, God knows, and I shall be glad to lend a
hand toward giving them their rights in all things."
As papa spoke, Chow-chow, who had caught sight of the peeping
faces, and was excited thereby, burst into a tremendous harangue,
waving her hands, stamping her feet, and dancing about on her
perch as if her wrongs had upset her wits. All of a suddent the
whole secretary lurched forward, out fell the drawers, open flew
the doors, down went Chow-chow with a screech, and the marble
slab came sliding after, as if to silence the irrepressible little orator
forever. How he did it no one knew, but before the top fell Cupid
was under it, received it on his shoulders, and held it up with all
his might, while Chow-chow scrambled out from the ruins with no
hurt but a bump on the forehead. Papa had his boy out in a
twinkling, and both mammas fell upon their rescued darlings with
equal alarm and tenderness; for Mrs. Susan got her little girl in her
arms before Mr. George could reach her, and Chow-chow clung
there, sobbing away her fright and pain as if the maternal purring
was a new and pleasant solace.
"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.

rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"I'll never play that nasty old puckerage anymore," she declared,
feeling of the purple lump on her brow.
"Nor I either, in that way," whispered her mamma, with a look that
made Chow-chow ask curiously,-
"Why, did you hurt yourself too?"
"I am afraid I did."
"Be sure that your platform is all right before you try again,
Poppet, else it will let you down when you least expact it, and
damage your best friends as well as yourself," said Mr. George,
setting up the fallen rostrum.
"I'm not going to have any platform; I'm going to be good and play
with Coopy, if he'll let me," added the penitent Chow-chow,
glancing with shy, wet eyes at Cupid, who stood near with a torn
jacket and a bruise on the already wounded hand.
His only answer was to draw her out of her mother's arms, embrace
her warmly, and seat her beside him on the little bench he loved to
share with her. This ready and eloquent forgiveness touched
Chow-chow's heart, and the lofty top-knot went down upon
Cupid's shoulder as if the little fortress lowered its colors in token
of entire surrender. Cupid's only sign of triumph was a gently pat
on the wild, black head, and a nod towards the spectators as he
said, smiling all over his chubby face,-
"Every thing is nice and happy now, and we don't mind the
bumps."
"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she

hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
I won't taste a bit."
"No, you eat it all, I'd like to see you. I don't care for it, truly,
'cause I love you more than million pies," protested Cupid, offering
back the treasure in a somewhat ruinous state after its various
vicissitudes.
"Then give me a tiny bit, and you have the rest," said Chow-chow,
bent on self-chastisement.
"The fairest way is to cut it 'zactly in halves, and each have a piece.
Mamma says that's the right thing to do always." And Cupid,
producing a jack-knive, proceeded to settle the matter with
masculine justice.
So side by side they devoured the little bone of contention,
chattering amicably about their plans; and as the last crumb
vanished, Cupid said persuasively, as if the league was not quite
perfect without that childish ceremony,-
"Now let's kiss and be friends, and never quarrel any more."
As the rosy mouths met in a kiss of peace, the sound was echoed
from the other room, for Mr. George's eyes made the same
proposal, and his wife answered it as tenderly as Chow-chow did
Cupid. Not a word was said, for grown people do not "'fess" and
forgive with the sweet frankness of children; but both felt that the
future would be happier than the past, thanks to the lesson they
had learned from the little romance of Cupid and Chow-chow.

Debby's Debut\n\n\t"Let us sheer off, we are only in the way," said Mr. George, and the
elders retired, but found it impossible to resist occasional peeps at
the little pair, as the reconciliation went on.
"O Coopy! I was so bad, I don't think you can love me anymore,"
began the repentant one with a sob.
"Oh yes I can; and just as soon as I get money enough, we'll go and
live in the swan-house, won't we?" returned the faithful lover,
making the most of this melting mood.
"I'll go right away tomorrow, I don't care about the money. I like
the nice bright pennies, and we don't need much, and I've got my
new saucepan to begin with," cried Chow-chow in a burst of
generosity, for, like a true woman, though she demanded
impossibilities at first, yet when her heart was won she asked
nothing but love, and was content with a saucepan.
"O Goody! and I've got my drum," returned the enraptured Cupid,
as ready as the immortal Tradles to go to housekeeping with a
toasting fork and a bird-cage, or some such useful trifles.
"But I was bad about the pie," cried Chow-chow as her sins kept
rising before her; and, burning to make atonement for this one, she
ran to the closet, tore out the pie, and, thrusting it into Cupid's
hands, said in a tone of heroic resolution, "There, you eat it all, and
