A Fox was caught in a trap one fine morning, because he had got
too near the Farmer's hen house. No doubt he was hungry, but that
was not an excuse for stealing. A Cock, rising early, discovered
what had happened. He knew the Fox could not get at him, so he
went a little closer to get a good look at his enemy.\n\n\tThe Fox saw a slender chance of escape.\n\n\t"Dear friend," he said, "I was just on my way to visit a sick
relative, when I stumbled into this string and got all tangled
up. But please do not tell anybody about it. I dislike causing
sorrow to anybody, and I am sure I can soon gnaw this string to
pieces."\n\n\tBut the Cock was not to be so easily fooled. He soon roused the
whole hen yard, and when the Farmer came running out, that was
the end of Mr. Fox.\n\n\tThe wicked deserve no aid.\n\n\t8.2
