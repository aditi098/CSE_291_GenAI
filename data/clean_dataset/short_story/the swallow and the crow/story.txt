The Swallow and the Crow had an argument one day about their plumage.\n\n\tSaid the Swallow: 'Just look at my bright and downy feathers. Your black stiff quills are not worth having. Why don't you dress better? Show a little pride!'\n\n\t'Your feathers may do very well in spring,' replied the Crow, 'but—I don't remember ever having seen you around in winter, and that's when I enjoy myself most.'\n\n\tFriends in fine weather only, are not worth much.\n\n\t               Add  The Swallow And The Crow to your library.
