An A.D.T. Kid carrying a Death Message marked 'Rush' stopped in front of a Show Window containing a Picture of James J. Jeffries and began to weep bitterly.\n\n\tA kind-hearted Suburbanite happened to be passing along on his Way to the 5:42 Train. He was carrying a Dog Collar, a Sickle, a Basket of Egg Plums and a Bicycle Tire.\n\n\tThe Suburbanite saw the A.D.T. Kid in Tears and it struck him that here was a Bully Chance to act out the Kind-Hearted Pedestrian who is always played up strong in the Sunday School Stories about Ralph and Edgar.\n\n\t'Why do you weep?' he asked, peering at the Boy through his concavo-convex Nose Glasses.\n\n\t'Oh, gee! I was just Thinking,' replied the Urchin, brokenly. 'I was just Thinking what chance have I got to grow up and be the Main Stem, like Mr. Jeffries.'\n\n\t'What a perverted Ambition!' exclaimed the Suburbanite. 'Why do you set up Mr. Jeffries as an Ideal? Why do you not strive to be like Me? Is it not worth a Life of Endeavor to command the Love and Respect of a Moral Settlement on the Outskirts? All the Conductors on our Division speak pleasantly to Me, and the Gateman has come to know my Name. Last year I had my Half-Tone in the Village Weekly for the mere Cost of the Engraving. When we opened Locust avenue from the Cemetery west to Alexander's Dairy, was I not a Member of the Committee appointed to present the Petition to the Councilmen? That's what I was! For Six Years I have been a Member of the League of American Wheelmen and now I am a Candidate for Director of our new four-hole Golf Club. Also I play Whist on the Train with a Man who once lived in the same House with T. DeWitt Talmage.'\n\n\tHearing these words the A.D.T. Kid ceased weeping and cheerfully proceeded up an Alley, where he played 'Wood Tag.'\n\n\tMoral: As the Twig is Bent the Tree is Inclined.\n\n\t               Add  The Fable of the Kid Who Shifted His Ideal to your library.
