Mary had a little lamb,
Its fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went,
The lamb was sure to go.
 
He followed, her to school one day;
That was against the rule;
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school.\n\n\tFeatured in our collection of Children's Poems\n\n\t7.7
