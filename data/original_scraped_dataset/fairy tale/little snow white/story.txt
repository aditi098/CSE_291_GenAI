Once upon a time in the middle of winter, when the flakes of snow were
falling like feathers from the sky, a queen sat at a window sewing,
and the frame of the window was made of black ebony. And whilst she
was sewing and looking out of the window at the snow, she pricked her
finger with the needle, and three drops of blood fell upon the snow. And
the red looked pretty upon the white snow, and she thought to herself,
"Would that I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as
black as the wood of the window-frame."\n\n\tSoon after that she had a little daughter, who was as white as snow, and
as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony; and she was therefore
called Little Snow-white. And when the child was born, the Queen died.\n\n\tAfter a year had passed the King took to himself another wife. She was a
beautiful woman, but proud and haughty, and she could not bear that anyone
else should surpass her in beauty. She had a wonderful looking-glass,
and when she stood in front of it and looked at herself in it, and said—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tthe looking-glass answered—-\n\n\t"Thou, O Queen, art the fairest of all!"\n\n\tThen she was satisfied, for she knew that the looking-glass spoke
the truth.\n\n\tBut Snow-white was growing up, and grew more and more beautiful; and
when she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the day, and more
beautiful than the Queen herself. And once when the Queen asked her
looking-glass —\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall, Who in this land is the
fairest of all?"\n\n\tit answered—-\n\n\t"Thou art fairer than all who are here, Lady Queen."
But more beautiful still is Snow-white, as I ween."\n\n\tThen the Queen was shocked, and turned yellow and green with envy. From
that hour, whenever she looked at Snow-white, her heart heaved in her
breast, she hated the girl so much.\n\n\tAnd envy and pride grew higher and higher in her heart like a weed,
so that she had no peace day or night. She called a huntsman, and said,
"Take the child away into the forest; I will no longer have her in my
sight. Kill her, and bring me back her heart as a token." The huntsman
obeyed, and took her away; but when he had drawn his knife, and was about
to pierce Snow-white's innocent heart, she began to weep, and said, "Ah
dear huntsman, leave me my life! I will run away into the wild forest,
and never come home again."\n\n\tAnd as she was so beautiful the huntsman had pity on her and said, "Run
away, then, you poor child." "The wild beasts will soon have devoured
you," thought he, and yet it seemed as if a stone had been rolled from
his heart since it was no longer needful for him to kill her. And as
a young boar just then came running by he stabbed it, and cut out its
heart and took it to the Queen as proof that the child was dead. The
cook had to salt this, and the wicked Queen ate it, and thought she had
eaten the heart of Snow-white.\n\n\tBut now the poor child was all alone in the great forest, and so terrified
that she looked at every leaf of every tree, and did not know what to
do. Then she began to run, and ran over sharp stones and through thorns,
and the wild beasts ran past her, but did her no harm.\n\n\tShe ran as long as her feet would go until it was almost evening; then
she saw a little cottage and went into it to rest herself. Everything
in the cottage was small, but neater and cleaner than can be told. There
was a table on which was a white cover, and seven little plates, and on
each plate a little spoon; moreover, there were seven little knives and
forks, and seven little mugs. Against the wall stood seven little beds
side by side, and covered with snow-white counterpanes.\n\n\tLittle Snow-white was so hungry and thirsty that she ate some vegetables
and bread from each plate and drank a drop of wine out of each mug, for
she did not wish to take all from one only. Then, as she was so tired,
she laid herself down on one of the little beds, but none of them suited
her; one was too long, another too short, but at last she found that the
seventh one was right, and so she remained in it, said a prayer and went
to sleep.\n\n\tWhen it was quite dark the owners of the cottage came back; they were
seven dwarfs who dug and delved in the mountains for ore. They lit their
seven candles, and as it was now light within the cottage they saw that
someone had been there, for everything was not in the same order in
which they had left it.\n\n\tThe first said, "Who has been sitting on my chair?"\n\n\tThe second, "Who has been eating off my plate?"\n\n\tThe third, "Who has been taking some of my bread?"\n\n\tThe fourth, "Who has been eating my vegetables?"\n\n\tThe fifth, "Who has been using my fork?"\n\n\tThe sixth, "Who has been cutting with my knife?"\n\n\tThe seventh, "Who has been drinking out of my mug?"\n\n\tThen the first looked round and saw that there was a little hole on his
bed, and he said, "Who has been getting into my bed?" The others came
up and each called out, "Somebody has been lying in my bed too." But
the seventh when he looked at his bed saw little Snow-white, who was
lying asleep therein. And he called the others, who came running up,
and they cried out with astonishment, and brought their seven little
candles and let the light fall on little Snow-white. "Oh, heavens! oh,
heavens!" cried they, "what a lovely child!" and they were so glad that
they did not wake her up, but let her sleep on in the bed. And the seventh
dwarf slept with his companions, one hour with each, and so got through
the night.\n\n\tWhen it was morning little Snow-white awoke, and was frightened when she
saw the seven dwarfs. But they were friendly and asked her what her name
was. "My name is Snow-white," she answered. "How have you come to our
house?" said the dwarfs. Then she told them that her step-mother had
wished to have her killed, but that the huntsman had spared her life,
and that she had run for the whole day, until at last she had found their
dwelling. The dwarfs said, "If you will take care of our house, cook,
make the beds, wash, sew, and knit, and if you will keep everything neat
and clean, you can stay with us and you shall want for nothing." "Yes,"
said Snow-white, "with all my heart," and she stayed with them. She kept
the house in order for them; in the mornings they went to the mountains
and looked for copper and gold, in the evenings they came back, and
then their supper had to be ready. The girl was alone the whole day,
so the good dwarfs warned her and said, "Beware of your step-mother,
she will soon know that you are here; be sure to let no one come in."\n\n\tBut the Queen, believing that she had eaten Snow-white's heart, could
not but think that she was again the first and most beautiful of all;
and she went to her looking-glass and said—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tand the glass answered —\n\n\t"Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,
But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,
Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she."\n\n\tThen she was astounded, for she knew that the looking-glass never spoke
falsely, and she knew that the huntsman had betrayed her, and that little
Snow-white was still alive.\n\n\tAnd so she thought and thought again how she might kill her, for so
long as she was not the fairest in the whole land, envy let her have no
rest. And when she had at last thought of something to do, she painted
her face, and dressed herself like an old pedler-woman, and no one could
have known her. In this disguise she went over the seven mountains to the
seven dwarfs, and knocked at the door and cried, "Pretty things to sell,
very cheap, very cheap." Little Snow-white looked out of the window and
called out, "Good-day my good woman, what have you to sell?" "Good things,
pretty things," she answered; "stay-laces of all colours," and she pulled
out one which was woven of bright-coloured silk. "I may let the worthy
old woman in," thought Snow-white, and she unbolted the door and bought
the pretty laces. "Child," said the old woman, "what a fright you look;
come, I will lace you properly for once." Snow-white had no suspicion,
but stood before her, and let herself be laced with the new laces. But
the old woman laced so quickly and so tightly that Snow-white lost her
breath and fell down as if dead. "Now I am the most beautiful," said
the Queen to herself, and ran away.\n\n\tNot long afterwards, in the evening, the seven dwarfs came home, but
how shocked they were when they saw their dear little Snow-white lying
on the ground, and that she neither stirred nor moved, and seemed to be
dead. They lifted her up, and, as they saw that she was laced too tightly,
they cut the laces; then she began to breathe a little, and after a while
came to life again. When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said,
"The old pedler-woman was no one else than the wicked Queen; take care
and let no one come in when we are not with you."\n\n\tBut the wicked woman when she had reached home went in front of the
glass and asked—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tand it answered as before—-\n\n\t"Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,
But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,
Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she."\n\n\tWhen she heard that, all her blood rushed to her heart with fear, for she
saw plainly that little Snow-white was again alive. "But now," she said,
"I will think of something that shall put an end to you," and by the help
of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisonous comb. Then
she disguised herself and took the shape of another old woman. So she
went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked at the door,
and cried, "Good things to sell, cheap, cheap!" Little Snow-white looked
out and said, "Go away; I cannot let any one come in." "I suppose you can
look," said the old woman, and pulled the poisonous comb out and held
it up. It pleased the girl so well that she let herself be beguiled,
and opened the door. When they had made a bargain the old woman said,
"Now I will comb you properly for once." Poor little Snow-white had no
suspicion, and let the old woman do as she pleased, but hardly had she
put the comb in her hair than the poison in it took effect, and the girl
fell down senseless. "You paragon of beauty," said the wicked woman,
"you are done for now," and she went away.\n\n\tBut fortunately it was almost evening, when the seven dwarfs came
home. When they saw Snow-white lying as if dead upon the ground they at
once suspected the step-mother, and they looked and found the poisoned
comb. Scarcely had they taken it out when Snow-white came to herself,
and told them what had happened. Then they warned her once more to be
upon her guard and to open the door to no one.\n\n\tThe Queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tthen it answered as before—-\n\n\t"Oh, Queen, thou art fairest of all I see,
But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,
Snow-white is still alive and well,\n\n\tAnd none is so fair as she."\n\n\tWhen she heard the glass speak thus she trembled and shook with rage.
"Snow-white shall die," she cried, "even if it costs me my life!"\n\n\tThereupon she went into a quite secret, lonely room, where no one ever
came, and there she made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked
pretty, white with a red cheek, so that everyone who saw it longed for
it; but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.\n\n\tWhen the apple was ready she painted her face, and dressed herself up
as a country-woman, and so she went over the seven mountains to the
seven dwarfs. She knocked at the door. Snow-white put her head out
of the window and said, "I cannot let any one in; the seven dwarfs
have forbidden me." "It is all the same to me," answered the woman,
"I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I will give you one."\n\n\t"No," said Snow-white, "I dare not take anything." "Are you afraid
of poison?" said the old woman; "look, I will cut the apple in two
pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white." The apple
was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white
longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of
it she could resist no longer, and stretched out her hand and took the
poisonous half. But hardly had she a bit of it in her mouth than she
fell down dead. Then the Queen looked at her with a dreadful look, and
laughed aloud and said, "White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood!
this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up again."\n\n\tAnd when she asked of the Looking-glass at home—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tit answered at last —\n\n\t"Oh, Queen, in this land thou art fairest of all."\n\n\tThen her envious heart had rest, so far as an envious heart can have rest.\n\n\tThe dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying
upon the ground; she breathed no longer and was dead. They lifted her up,
looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her,
combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use;
the poor child was dead, and remained dead. They laid her upon a bier, and
all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept three days long.\n\n\tThen they were going to bury her, but she still looked as if she were
living, and still had her pretty red cheeks. They said, "We could not
bury her in the dark ground," and they had a transparent coffin of
glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides, and they laid
her in it, and wrote her name upon it in golden letters, and that she
was a king's daughter. Then they put the coffin out upon the mountain,
and one of them always stayed by it and watched it. And birds came too,
and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.\n\n\tAnd now Snow-white lay a long, long time in the coffin, and she did not
change, but looked as if she were asleep; for she was as white as snow,
as red as blood, and her hair was as black as ebony.\n\n\tIt happened, however, that a king's son came into the forest, and went to
the dwarfs' house to spend the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain,
and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written upon it
in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarfs, "Let me have the coffin,
I will give you whatever you want for it." But the dwarfs answered,
"We will not part with it for all the gold in the world." Then he said,
"Let me have it as a gift, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I
will honour and prize her as my dearest possession." As he spoke in this
way the good dwarfs took pity upon him, and gave him the coffin.\n\n\tAnd now the King's son had it carried away by his servants on their
shoulders. And it happened that they stumbled over a tree-stump,
and with the shock the poisonous piece of apple which Snow-white had
bitten off came out of her throat. And before long she opened her eyes,
lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was once more alive. "Oh,
heavens, where am I?" she cried. The King's son, full of joy, said,
"You are with me," and told her what had happened, and said, "I love you
more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace,
you shall be my wife."\n\n\tAnd Snow-white was willing, and went with him, and their wedding was
held with great show and splendour. But Snow-white's wicked step-mother
was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful
clothes she went before the Looking-glass, and said—-\n\n\t"Looking-glass, Looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?"\n\n\tthe glass answered—-\n\n\t"Oh, Queen, of all here the fairest art thou,
But the young Queen is fairer by far as I trow."\n\n\tThen the wicked woman uttered a curse, and was so wretched, so utterly
wretched, that she knew not what to do. At first she would not go to
the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young
Queen. And when she went in she knew Snow-white; and she stood still
with rage and fear, and could not stir. But iron slippers had already
been put upon the fire, and they were brought in with tongs, and set
before her. Then she was forced to put on the red-hot shoes, and dance
until she dropped down dead.\n\n\tWe offer an alternate version that may be more appropriate for younger children in our Short Stories for Children, Snow White\n\n\t8.8
