A Boy, stung by a Nettle, ran home crying, to get his mother to blow on the hurt and kiss it.\n\n\t said the Boy's mother, when she had comforted him, 'the next time you come near a Nettle, grasp it firmly, and it will be as soft as silk.'\n\n\tWhatever you do, do with all your might.\n\n\t               Add  The Boy And The Nettle to your library.
