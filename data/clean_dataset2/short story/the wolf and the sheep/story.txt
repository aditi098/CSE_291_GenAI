A Wolf had been hurt in a fight with a Bear. He was unable to move and could not satisfy his hunger and thirst. A Sheep passed by near his hiding place, and the Wolf called to him.\n\n\t he begged, 'that might give me strength enough so I can get me some solid food.Solid food!That means me, I suppose. If I should bring you a drink, it would only serve to wash me down your throat. Don't talk to me about a drink!'\n\n\tA knave's hypocrisy is easily seen through.\n\n\t               Add  The Wolf And The Sheep to your library.
