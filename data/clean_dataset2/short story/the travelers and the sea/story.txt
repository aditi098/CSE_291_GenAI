Two Travelers were walking along the seashore. Far out they saw something riding on the waves.\n\n\t said one, 'a great ship rides in from distant lands, bearing rich treasures!No,that is not a treasure ship. That is some fisherman's skiff, with the day's catch of savoury fish.It is a chest of gold lost from some wreck,' they cried. Both Travelers rushed to the beach, but there they found nothing but a water-soaked log.\n\n\tDo not let your hopes carry you away from reality.\n\n\t               Add  The Travelers And The Sea to your library.
