An Eagle sat high in the branches of a great Oak. She seemed very sad and drooping for an Eagle. A Kite saw her.\n\n\t'Why do you look so woebegone?' asked the Kite.\n\n\t'I want to get married,' replied the Eagle, 'and I can't find a mate who can provide for me as I should like.'\n\n\t'Take me,' said the Kite; 'I am very strong, stronger even than you!'\n\n\t'Do you really think you can provide for me?' asked the Eagle eagerly.\n\n\t'Why, of course,' replied the Kite. 'That would be a very simple matter. I am so strong I can carry away an Ostrich in my talons as if it were a feather!'\n\n\tThe Eagle accepted the Kite immediately. But after the wedding, when the Kite flew away to find something to eat for his bride, all he had when he returned, was a tiny Mouse.\n\n\t'Is that the Ostrich you talked about?' said the Eagle in disgust.\n\n\t'To win you I would have said and promised anything,' replied the Kite.\n\n\tEverything is fair in love.\n\n\t9.5                Add  The Eagle And The Kite to your library.
